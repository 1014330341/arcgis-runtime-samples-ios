##Offline Routing Sample 

This sample demonstrates how you can compute routes even when the device does not have any network connectivity.
The sample uses a tile package (.tpk file) containing basemap tiles for downtown San Francisco. 
The sample also contains a network dataset with information about the streets network for the area.


###Using the sample
1. Tap-and-hold anywhere on the map to add a stop. Move your finger while still holding down on the map to move the stop. 
2. A route is computed between the stops, and updated as you move your finger. The banner on the top shows travel time and distance.
3. You can add another stop by releasing your finger, and then tap-and-holding again.
4. You can switch between the **Shortest** and the **Fastest** options to update the route.
5. You can tap on **Reorder** to rearrange the stops and find the best route.
6. You can use the **Prev** and **Next** buttons to step through the directions one-by-one. 
7. Tap **Reset** to clear all stops/routes and start again.
